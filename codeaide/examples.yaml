  - description: Create a Pong Game using Pygame
    prompt: |
      Create a Pong game with these features:

      • Left paddle controlled by player (up/down keys)
      • Right paddle controlled by simple AI (add a small delay to make it beatable)
      • Ball that bounces off paddles and screen edges
      • Score display for player and AI
      • Game ends when one side reaches 5 points
      • Full screen display

      Provide complete, commented Python code for this game. Ensure the AI paddle moves smoothly and provides a fair challenge.

  - description: Simple MNIST Image Classifier with PyTorch
    prompt: |
      Create a basic neural network classifier for the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. The implementation should include the following steps:

      1. Import necessary libraries (torch, torchvision)
      2. Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
      3. Define a simple neural network architecture
      4. Set up the training loop
      5. Train the model
      6. Evaluate the model's performance
      7. Generate a visualization showing some correct and incorrect predictions

      Specific requirements:
      • Use a feedforward neural network with two hidden layers
      • Use ReLU activation for hidden layers and softmax for the output layer
      • Use CrossEntropyLoss as the loss function
      • Use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimizer
      • Train for 5 epochs
      • Include progress bars for training and validation
      • Print the training loss after each epoch
      • Evaluate and print the accuracy on the test set after training
      • The visualization should include a grid of images with their predicted and true labels. Show 10 examples of correct predictions and 10 examples of incorrect predictions.
      • Make sure the visualization is compact enough to be displayed on a standard laptop screen

      Please provide the complete Python code to implement this MNIST classifier, including comments explaining each major step.

  - description: CSV Generation and Clustering Analysis/Visualization
    prompt: |
      Create a Python script that does the following:

      1. Generate a CSV file with synthetic data for customer segmentation. Include the following columns where data in each column should be randomly generated from 3 different distributions to represent 3 clusters:
        - Customer ID
        - Age
        - Annual Income
        - Spending Score (1-100)
      2. Save the CSV file to disk.
      3. Read the CSV file back into a pandas DataFrame.
      4. Perform k-means clustering on the data using Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
      5. Visualize the results using a 2D scatter plot with:
        - Axes representing Annual Income and Spending Score.
        - Dot size proportional to the Age of the customer.
        - Color designating the cluster they belong to.
      6. Print basic statistics for each cluster (mean age, income, and spending score).

      Please provide the complete Python code, including necessary imports and comments explaining each major step.

  - description: Function generation and testing
    prompt: |
      Create a Python function that checks the strength of a password, along with a unit test for this function. The requirements are as follows:

      1. Implement a function called `check_password_strength(password: str) -> str` that:
        - Returns "Strong" if the password is at least 8 characters long and contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
        - Returns "Moderate" if the password is at least 8 characters long and meets any three of the above criteria.
        - Returns "Weak" for all other cases.

      2. Write a unit test for the `check_password_strength` function. The test should cover at least the following cases:
        - A strong password
        - A moderate password
        - A weak password
        - An empty string

      Please provide the complete Python code for both the `check_password_strength` function and its associated unit test, including necessary imports and comments explaining the implementation and test cases.
      Please provide a good docstring for the function explaining its purpose and expected input/output.
      For simplicity, please put the function and test in the same file.
